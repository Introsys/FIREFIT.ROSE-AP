The Badges above demonstrate testing, code coverage
and commitment to coding standards (since the code is linted on commit).

The links need to be amended to point to the correct repo.

Sign up for:

- CI Test system - e.g. GitHub Actions, Travis
- A Documentation website - e.g. ReadTheDocs
- Static Code Analysis tool - e.g. Codacy
- CII Best Practices https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org

Only CII Best Practices (and its badge) is mandatory. Any equivalent public automated tools for the other three may be used.

Note that the CII Best Practices questionaire will request evidence of tooling used.
